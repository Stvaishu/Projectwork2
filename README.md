## Title of the Project
A SUCCESSFUL METHOD OF MELANOMA CANCER DETECTION THROUGH DEEP LEARNING​

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project presents recent advancements of using computer- vision based systems for classification of liver varieties. A computer-vision application using image processing techniques involves five basic processes such as image acquisition, pre- processing, segmentation, object detection, and classification. ​

​

## Features
Feature extraction is extracting or showing of the segmented portion of the image so that classification becomes easy. Features are extracted in order to differentiate between the images. Features extraction is used in almost all Deep vision algorithms. The common goal of feature extraction and representation techniques is to convert the segmented objects into representations that better describe their main features and attributes.

Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
This project demonstrates the modeling of skin cancer as classification task and describes the implementation of DL approach for classifying skin cancer as either benign or malignant. The results of DL were compared on the basis of accuracy with existing system. It was observed that classification implemented by DL technique in this project is more efficient compare to existing algorithms as seen in the accuracy and precision. Based on the results, ML technique is more efficient compared to other existing methods technique in liver cancer detection.
